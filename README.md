# Custom Neural Network Package

## Description

This repository contains a custom neural network package designed for educational purposes, specifically to demonstrate the concept of backpropagation. The package is implemented in Python 3 and utilizes NumPy for matrix operations.

The key components of the package are:

- **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers**: Implementation of dense layers for feedforward neural networks, which are used to connect each neuron from one layer to every neuron in the next layer.

- **Input Layer**: An input layer that allows you to define the input dimensions of your neural network.

- **Loss Functions**: Support for commonly used loss functions like mean squared error (MSE), and categorical cross-entropy.

- **Model**: A high-level interface for building, training, and using neural networks. It allows you to add layers sequentially, set hyperparameters, train the model, and make predictions.

## Installation

To use this custom neural network package, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
